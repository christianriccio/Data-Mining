# Data-Mining
This is repo for the Data Mining exam's project. 
The goal is to classifify the network traffic in normakl and malignant, also there are present several classes og malignant traffic. Deep Learning is envolved for solve the task, in fact a Convolutional NN with ResNet50 architecture is built. The final result gives a precison of about 99% for the classification task. The goal would be to perform real time analysis of the network traffic with the future purpose of built an Intelligent NIDS
two files are listed:
- the .pdf is the presentation for the discussion of the work.
- data_mining_exam.ipynb is the notebook of the worked project. 

 For a better undertandig of the whole work use the presentation as a starting point. Italian only is avaiable
